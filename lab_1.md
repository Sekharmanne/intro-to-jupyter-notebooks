# Introduction to data analysis with Pandas
You might think that **Python** is only for developers and people with computer science degrees. However, Python is great for beginners, even those with little coding experience because it’s free, open source, and runs on any platform. The Python packages documentation is great, and after an [introductory course](https://cognitiveclass.ai/learn/data-science-with-python), you have a good foundation to build on.

Python is a general purpose and high-level programming language that is used for more than working with data. For example, it’s good for developing desktop GUI applications, websites, and web applications. However, this tutorial focuses on the data and only goes through getting started with data.

**Pandas** is an open source Python Library that provides high-performance data manipulation and analysis. With the combination of Python and pandas, you can accomplish five typical steps in the processing and analysis of data, regardless of the origin of data: load, prepare, manipulate, model, and analyze.

There are many options when working with the data using pandas. The following list shows some of the things that can be done using pandas.

* Cleaning data by removing or replacing missing values
* Converting data formats
* Sorting rows
* Deleting or adding rows and columns
* Merging or joining DataFrames
* Summarizing data by pivoting or reshaping
* Creating visualizations

This list is far from complete. See the pandas [documentation](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/) for more of what you can do.

## Workshop 

#### Step 1 - [Create a new project in Watson Studio](https://github.com/pmmistry/intro-to-jupyter-notebooks#create-a-new-project)

#### Step 2 - Load and Run a Notebook
-  Add a new notebook. Click `Add to project` and choose `Notebook`:

- Choose new notebook `From URL`. Give your notebook a name and copy the URL : `https://github.com/pmmistry/intro-to-jupyter-notebooks/blob/master/notebooks/into-to-pandas.ipynb`

- Select the default runtime and click `Create Notebook`. 
-  The notebook will load. 
You are now ready to follow along with the workshop in the notebook!
