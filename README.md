# Intro to Jupyter Notebooks 
[Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) are an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and explanatory text.

In this workshop we will use [IBM Watson Studio](https://dataplatform.cloud.ibm.com/docs/content/wsj/getting-started/overview-ws.html) to run various notebooks. For this you will need an IBM Cloud account. The following steps will show you how sign up and get started. 

There are three labs in this workshop where you will learn : 
* Lab 1 : Intro to Pandas 
* Lab 2 : Intro to PixieDust
* Lab 3 : Intro to Predictive Modeling with Watson Machine Learning 

## Before You Get Started 

 - [Sign up](https://ibm.biz/BdqqiN) for an IBM Cloud account

- When you are signed up click `Create Resource` at the top of the Resources page. You can find the resources under the hamburger menu at the top left:
